<p>Rhythmic patterns in neural time series provide a window on the neural dynamics that shape perception, cognition and action, and therefore are a major signal of interest in the cognitive, computational and systems neurosciences. However, typical descriptions of rhythmicity lack detail, e.g., failing to indicate when and for how long rhythms occur. Such lack of detail becomes problematic in the face of non-stationarities in rhythmic engagement, i.e., when the presence of rhythms varies over time. To overcome resulting pitfalls, there is a need for methods that identify the occurence of non-stationary rhythmic periods in a systematic manner.</p>

<p>eBOSC (extended Better OSCillation detection) is a toolbox (or a set of scripts) that can be used to detect the occurrence of rhythms in continuous signals (i.e., at the single trial level). It uses a static aperiodic â€˜backgroundâ€™ spectrum as the basis to define a â€˜power thresholdâ€™ that continuous signals have to exceed in order to qualify as â€˜rhythmicâ€™. As such, it leverages the observation that stochastic components of the frequency spectrum of neural data are characterized by a â€˜1/fâ€™-like power spectrum. An additional â€˜duration thresholdâ€™ can be set up in advance, or rhythmic episodes can be filtered by duration following detection to ensure that detected rhythmic episodes have a rather sustained vs. transient appearance. The main goal of the code is to produce a list of rhythmic episodes.</p>
