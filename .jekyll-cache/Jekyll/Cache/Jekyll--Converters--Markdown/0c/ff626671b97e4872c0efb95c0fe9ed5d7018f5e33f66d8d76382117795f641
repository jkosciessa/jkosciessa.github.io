I"<p>I am a post-doctoral researcher currently at the <a href="https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en">Max Planck Institute for Human Development</a>, associated with the <a href="https://www.mps-ucl-centre.mpg.de/en/about-the-centre/research-groups/lifespan-neural-dynamics-group">Lifespan Neural Dynamics Group</a>. Prior to my doctoral studies in the <a href="https://www.mps-ucl-centre.mpg.de/comp2psych">IMPRS Comp2Psych program</a>, I completed an M.Sc. in the <a href="http://www.mind-and-brain.de/home/">Berlin School of Mind and Brain program</a> at Humboldt UniversitÃ¤t zu Berlin.</p>

<p>I have a broad interest in Cognitive Psychology, Computational Neuroscience, Machine Learning, and Computational Biology and employ an array of techniques, including <em>computational modeling of behavior</em>, electroencephalography (<em>EEG</em>), structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (<em>s/fMRI</em>), <em>pupillometry</em> as well as <em>numerical simulations</em>.</p>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

<p><strong>General.</strong> I am particularly interested how neural dynamics can practically constrain implementations of cognition. Specifically, I am interested in different dynamic regimes in the brain, and their non-invasive assessment. At the psychological level, I am interested in how the brain represents, and adapts, to environmental uncertainty around it. Linking these interests, I suggest that different cortical regimes may be dynamically engaged via subcortical structures and neuromodulation to manage perception and cognition.</p>

<p><strong>Dynamic characterization of neural rhythms.</strong> Neural rhythms are considered to provide insights into how the human brain coordinates information processing in time and space. However, rhythms may not be constantly present in neural recordings and a major goal is to identify rhythmic periods in time to better characterize these rhythmic signals and unlock insights into their generation and function.</p>

<p><strong>Characterization of â€˜neural complexityâ€™.</strong> Aside from neural rhythms, the brain can dynamically interact across multiple temporal and spatial scales (think â€˜communicationâ€™ within and across brain regions). This gives rise to a plethora of signatures observed at the scalp. A major goal is to better characterize these fluctuations to infer the presence of different cortical activity regimes.</p>

<p><strong>Facing environmental uncertainty.</strong> Humans frequently face complex environments that feature varying degrees of uncertainty about what should receive priority in processing. A major question is how the brain identifies this uncertainty, and how it changes its dynamics to account for elevated uncertainty, to create an adaptive course of action.</p>

<p><strong>Thalamic influences on cortical dynamics and cognition.</strong> While traditionally considered an early relay for sensory information, the centrally-located thalamus is ideally suited to exert a large influence on the fine computations in cortex. However, its multifaceted influence on the dynamics of cortical networks and higher-order cognition is only starting to be uncovered. I use a multi-modal approach combining high temporal resolution in the cortical EEG with high spatial resolution with fMRI to probe these conceptual relations.</p>
