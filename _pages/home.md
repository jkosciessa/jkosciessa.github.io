I am a post-doctoral researcher currently at the [Max Planck Institute for Human Development](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en), associated with the [Lifespan Neural Dynamics Group](https://www.mps-ucl-centre.mpg.de/en/about-the-centre/research-groups/lifespan-neural-dynamics-group). Prior to my doctoral studies in the [IMPRS Comp2Psych program](https://www.mps-ucl-centre.mpg.de/comp2psych), I completed an M.Sc. in the [Berlin School of Mind and Brain program](http://www.mind-and-brain.de/home/) at Humboldt Universität zu Berlin. 

I have a broad interest in Cognitive Psychology, Computational Neuroscience, Machine Learning, and Computational Biology and employ an array of techniques, including *computational modeling of behavior*, electroencephalography (*EEG*), structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (*s/fMRI*), *pupillometry* as well as *numerical simulations*.

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

**General.** I am particularly interested how neural dynamics practically constrain implementations of cognition. Specifically, I am interested in different dynamic regimes in the brain, and their non-invasive assessment. At the psychological level, I am interested in how the brain represents, and adapts, to environmental uncertainty around it. Linking these interests, I consider the role of subcortical structures and neuromodulation in the dynamic engagement of cortical regimes in service of perception, cognition and action.

**Dynamic characterization of neural rhythms.** Neural rhythms provide insights into how the human brain coordinates information processing in time and space. However, rhythms are not constantly present in neural recordings and a major goal is to identify rhythmic periods in time to better characterize these rhythmic signals and unlock insights into their generation and function.

**Characterization of ‘neural complexity’.** Aside from neural rhythms, the brain can dynamically interact across multiple temporal and spatial scales (e.g., within and across brain regions). This gives rise to a plethora of signatures observed at the scalp. A major goal is to better characterize these fluctuations to infer the presence of different cortical activity regimes.

**Facing environmental uncertainty.** Humans frequently face complex environments with varying degrees of uncertainty about what should receive priority in processing. A major interest of mine concerns how the brain identifies this uncertainty, and how it changes its dynamics to create an adaptive course of action.

**Thalamic influences on cortical dynamics and cognition.** While traditionally considered an early relay for sensory information, the centrally-located thalamus is ideally suited to exert a large influence on the fine computations in cortex. However, its multifaceted influence on the dynamics of cortical networks and higher-order cognition is only starting to be uncovered. I use a multi-modal approach combining high temporal resolution in the cortical EEG with high spatial resolution with fMRI to probe these conceptual relations.
